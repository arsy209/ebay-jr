# Part 3: Build a CRUD App

## Summary

In Part 3 of the assessment, we'll demonstrate our proficiency in building
web-stack applications: user authentication, associations, validations,
controllers, views, etc. Even a little bit of CSS.

### Site Overview

We'll be building a simplified version of a blind auction site. In a blind
auction, bidders do not see how much other bidders have bid.

The required functionality of the site will be described in more detail in the
*Releases* section, but here's a basic overview.

#### All Users

- Browse available items

#### Unregistered Users**

- Register a new account

#### Registered Users

- Sign in
- Sign out
- List new items
- Place bids on items
- Have a profile showing their listing and bidding activity
